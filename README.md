# Momentum v1.0

Another little "solve your own problem library" - this time
a progress bar for async page loading visualistion for the
UI.

## Installation

$npm install

$bower install

$grunt build

If you wanted to make changes you can also use:

$grunt watch

## TODO

* Abstract the carriage position from the CSS so it's programmatically attributed from something like [PJazz's](https://github.com/Flowdeeps/pjazz) progress AJAX page-load function
* Add a rail hide function when page load is complete
